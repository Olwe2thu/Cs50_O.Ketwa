                <h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
                <p>Atomic habits are small, incremental changes or routines that compound over time to yield significant results.
                      These habits focus on making tiny adjustments in behavior that, when repeated consistently, lead to long-term improvements
                      and personal growth.
                      The term "atomic" emphasizes the minuscule nature of these habits, akin to the building blocks of larger systems.
                      By breaking down habits into manageable components and integrating them into daily routines,
                    individuals can gradually transform their lives and achieve their goals with lasting impact.</p>
